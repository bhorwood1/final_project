      <h4>
<p>A city of endless possibilities, high energy and great diversity, New York has always been the benchmark for first-rate dining, unparalleled shopping and cultural activity. 
It's love at first sight when the Empire State Building comes into view, and the Statue of Liberty awes even the most blase tourist. Broadway shows will wow you; browsing Bloomingdale's will amaze you. The views from the Staten Island Ferry are a knockout, and downtown nightlife will keep you busy in the city that never sleeps.</p>
<p>You'll find Central Park smack dab in the middle of New York with many of the city's best museums on either side. Check out the Upper East Side for high fashion. On the Upper West Side, you'll find Time Warner Center's luxurious shops and restaurants at Columbus Circle; operas, concerts, dance and theater at Lincoln Center; and bustling neighborhood street life along Broadway, including Columbia University.</p>
<p>Surrounding Manhattan are Brooklyn, the Bronx, Queens and Staten Island. Many Brooklyn neighborhoods have become as popular and chic as Manhattan's. Smart shops and trendy restaurants have spread like wildfire, drawing Manhattanites across the river for fashionable dining and serious shopping.</p></h4>
